# ML-Genetic-Algorithm---Cars

A solo project I started a mid july 2021, because I like Machine Learning and I wanted to learn more.
Genetic algorithm with selection of the best of each generation, crossover and adding some randomness to weights and bias.
Basic for ML, but I had fun and I was happy with what I learnt.

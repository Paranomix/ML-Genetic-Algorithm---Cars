# ML-Genetic-Algorithm---Cars

A solo project I started a mid july 2021, because I like Machine Learning and I wanted to learn more.
Genetic algorithm with selection of the best of each generation, crossover and adding some randomness to weights and bias.
Basic for ML, but I had fun and I was happy with what I learnt.

On the first level, the training is basically complete (1 of the agents does reach the end). So, I move on the 2nd level, where it does take a bit of time to learn. The agents do not struggle with the of the 2nd level that is equal to the 1st level, but, on the last curve, they do make the right turn, crashing into the wall. On the 2nd level, the 7th place (last place of that keeps to "survive" and is used for crossovers) is +19 units away from the goal, while the 1st place is only at ~3.3 units. By the end of this video, the top places range between 2.5 to 6 units, being visible a somewhat slow learning.

After an hour of training, the top agents still struggle with one curve, but are able to cross and complete level 2 rather smoothly.
